## Intention

The primary goal of this final project is to guide you through the comprehensive process of data analysis within the context of basketball performance metrics. 
Our focus is on evaluating the performance data of basketball players over the past six years (2018-2024), specifically to identify trends and correlations that can help predict the Most Improved Player (MIP) in future seasons. 
The MIP award is given annually to the player who has shown the most significant improvement in their performance, making it an intriguing subject for data-driven analysis.

Why is this important? Recognizing and predicting the Most Improved Player can provide valuable insights into player development, scouting, and team strategy. Understanding the factors that contribute to a player's improvement can help teams invest in potential stars early, optimize training programs, and enhance overall team performance. 
Moreover, fans and analysts alike can gain a deeper appreciation for the game's dynamics and the players' growth trajectories.

Throughout this project, we utilize a variety of data science techniques to analyze player statistics, performance metrics, and other relevant data points. 
By examining past MIP winners and comparing their performance data to other players, we aim to uncover patterns and predictive indicators. 

Our analysis focuses on several key aspects:

- **Data Collection:** Gathering comprehensive player data from the past six years, including points per game, offensive and defensive rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals.
  
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Ensuring the data is accurate, complete, and formatted for analysis.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and summarizing the data to identify trends, anomalies, and initial insights.
  
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new variables and metrics that might be significant predictors of improvement.
  
- **Modeling and Prediction:** Applying various statistical and machine learning models to predict future MIP candidates based on historical data.
  
- **Evaluation and Interpretation:** Assessing the performance of our models and interpreting the results to draw meaningful conclusions.
  
By following this structured approach, we aim to provide a robust analysis that not only identifies potential future MIP candidates but also enhances our understanding of the factors driving player improvement in professional basketball.
